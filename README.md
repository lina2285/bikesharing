#Summary of Results

Based on the data compiled, the NYC bike-sharing data helped illustrate who to target and the best times for the business. Before concluding the results, we must consider that Des Moines is a much smaller city than New York City. The similarities or differences between the two will help pinpoint the right strategies. According to https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/des_moines_ia/new_york_ny/people, the Des Moines population is 2.6% of New York City. By understanding the difference in population, we can estimate a maximum utilization of 61,000 rides per month (2,344,224 * 2.6%). The key observations from the data are that most users are subscribers and male users. Additionally, The primary user is an individual using the service to communiting to/from work.  

In NYC, the average commute is 5-8 minutes. It will be essential to understand the average work commute for Des Moines. Will the commute also range under 10 minutes? If the commute is longer, will individuals be willing to use the bike-sharing system as much as it is used in NYC?

##Additional analysis

* Length of commute for Des Moines residents.
